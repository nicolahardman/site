            "I am an adult student. When I first attended lessons with Nic I was very shy and lacked in confidence. Due to Nic's bespoke, holistic style of teaching my confidence has soared and my singing is much improved. Nic cares about her students and builds on each individual's strengths."

            I am happy to offer my singing students the opportunity to take exams with several creative bodies (including those named above) if they wish. These include singing styles and genres in Pop, Musical Theatre, Classical, Rock and Leisure. I will firstly offer advice and help to my students so they may choose which genre of exam to take, and then deliver the appropriate programme to get them the best results they are capable of. I am very happy to be able to say that all of my students who have
taken exams have passed with at least a merit!

        "Nic is the best singing teacher ever! I am always excited when it's my lesson, I've learnt so much about singing &amp; performing, Nic gives me the confidence to sing out loud &amp; in front of anyone. When I did my first exam, I didn't know what to expect, Nic made sure I understood what they expected from me &amp; worked really hard to achieve a great performance. I was the happiest girl ever when I received a Distinction, Thank you so much Nic, you are AWESOME!" <br/>

            Performing live is an extremely important and integral practice which I encourage all my students to participate in. As a performance artist who regularly performs live, I understand how terrifying this concept can be, especially to new or more inexperienced singers. I will offer full empathic support to build self confidence, and use a microphone during sessions leading up to performances to teach the correct method. I always accompany each student during performances in a key which
            I tailor to suit them so that they feel both comfortable and confident.

My students have performed at several local venues and festivals such as 'Formby Live', The Formby Christmas lights switch on in the village centre and we also perform termly at Lady Green garden centre in Ince Blundell colllecting for charities. I also offer the opportunity for students to perform in annual music festivals such as the Southport Music Festival held in Meols Cop High School, and 18+ students have the option to perform in local open mic nights to gain experience and confidence.
