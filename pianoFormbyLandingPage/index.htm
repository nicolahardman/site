						I am happy to offer my piano students the opportunity to take exams with several creative bodies (including those named above) if they wish. These can be both practical or theory exams which include genres in Classical, Jazz and Pop / Rock. I will firstly offer advice and help to my students so they may choose which genre of exam to take, point them to the relevant revision and support material and then deliver the appropriate programme to get them the best results they are capable of.  I am very happy to be able to say that all of my students who have taken piano exams have passed with at least a merit!

        "As a parent of two of Nic's students, I can't praise her enough. Both my daughters love their piano and singing lessons and always come out smiling. Nic oozes positivity and gives them the confidence they need to perform. They have both performed publically in front of lots of people, something they wouldn't have done without Nic and her constant enthusiasm and encouragement. Nic you are a fantastic teacher and I think you for all your hard work." <br/>

						Performing live is an extremely important and integral practice which I encourage all my students to participate in. As a performance artist who regularly performs live, I understand how terrifying this concept can be, especially to new or more inexperienced players. I will offer full empathic support to my students to build self confidence during sessions leading up to performances so that they feel both comfortable and confident.
